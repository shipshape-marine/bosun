/**
 * Serializes multi-statement transactions across all writers on the shared
 * sqlite3 connection.
 *
 * Every bulk writer (power ADC, power states, IMU, strain) wraps its work in
 * BEGIN ... COMMIT. sqlite3 gives the whole process one connection, so two
 * writers overlapping produce "cannot start a transaction within a transaction"
 * and lose a batch. The power path never hit this because all of its writes
 * funnel through onNewSample sequentially; the IMU and strain flush timers fire
 * on wall-clock intervals independent of that path, so they can interleave.
 *
 * This is a queue, not a busy-wait: callers await their turn, the event loop
 * stays free, and the serial reader never awaits any of this. Throughput is
 * unaffected because sqlite3 already executes statements one at a time on this
 * connection - the lock only stops the BEGIN/COMMIT pairs from interleaving.
